title: AI-Powered SQL Generation
description: Effortlessly query your logs using natural language with LogChef's AI capabilities.
---

LogChef leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate your natural language questions about your logs directly into ClickHouse SQL queries. This feature is designed to lower the barrier to entry for log exploration, allowing users less familiar with SQL to gain insights quickly, and speeding up query construction for experienced users.

Simply type your query in plain English, and LogChef will do its best to generate the appropriate SQL to fetch the data you need from your connected ClickHouse log sources.

## How it Works

When you use the AI SQL generation feature for a specific log source, LogChef provides the underlying table schema and your natural language query to an AI model. The model then constructs a ClickHouse SQL query tailored to your request and the schema of your data.

## Example Natural Language Queries

Below are examples of natural language queries you can use with LogChef, demonstrating the versatility of the AI SQL generation feature. These are tailored for common log exploration use cases.

### üîç Severity & Error Investigation

1.  "Show all error logs from the last 6 hours."
2.  "List logs with severity higher than warning in the last day."
3.  "Find critical logs from service `auth-service` today."
4.  "Show logs with severity_text equal to 'ERROR' and body containing 'timeout'."

---

### üïí Time-based Exploration

5.  "Show the most recent 20 logs from the `api-gateway` service."
6.  "List all logs between 2 PM and 3 PM yesterday for the syslog namespace."
7.  "Count logs per hour for the last 12 hours."

---

### üß© Trace & Debugging

8.  "Find all logs with trace_id `abc123`."
9.  "Show logs grouped by trace_id for the last 30 minutes."
10. "Get logs where trace_flags is not zero."

---

### üì¶ Service/Namespace Filtering

11. "List logs from the `payments` namespace with severity ERROR."
12. "Show logs for `checkout-service` in the `default` namespace."
13. "Get all log bodies from the `syslog` namespace for the last 12 hours."

---

### üß† Attributes and Content Search

14. "Find logs where log_attributes contain key `user_id` and value `42`."
15. "Search for logs where body mentions 'database connection failed'."
16. "List logs where log_attributes include `env=prod`."

---

### üìà Aggregation & Trends

17. "Count logs by severity_text for the last 24 hours."
18. "Top 5 services by number of ERROR logs today."
19. "How many logs were generated by each namespace in the last hour?"

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Miscellaneous Debug Scenarios

20. "Show logs where `span_id` is missing or empty."
21. "Find logs that contain both `retry` and `failed` in the body."
22. "List logs where severity_number is greater than 13 and contains 'exception'."

## Tips for Effective Queries

- **Be Specific:** The more context you provide, the better the AI can understand your intent. Mention specific services, namespaces, error messages, or timeframes.
- **Use Natural Language:** Don't try to force SQL-like syntax. Plain, clear English works best.
- **Iterate:** If the first query doesn't give you exactly what you want, try rephrasing it or adding more detail.

## A Note on Accuracy

While powerful, AI-generated SQL should always be reviewed, especially for critical or complex queries. The feature is a tool to assist and accelerate your log exploration, not a complete replacement for understanding your data and query logic.
